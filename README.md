## Fairer Chess

### the idea
I tried to remove the last bit of unfairness from chess (that one player has the first move) by letting both players enter their move at the same time and execute both moves at once (details are on the website)

I think this idea failed to be an interresting playing experience, but now that I did the work why not share
